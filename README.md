# A collection of USB Rubber Ducky Payloads
A collection of Duckyscript payloads for use with BadUSB devices.  
Many of these scripts are simply "wrappers" to download [these](https://github.com/CWright2022/powershell_malware) powershell scripts.  
These all will work with any DuckyScript compatible device (including Flipper Zero), and are written with DuckyScript 1.0.
